## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer and Communication Engineering at Alexandria University. My major has given me a strong foundation in both software and hardware aspects of technology, and I am particularly passionate about learning and growing in the field of web development. I am also an avid competitive programmer, actively engaging on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.
